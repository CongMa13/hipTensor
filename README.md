#hipTENSOR
TODO: <br>
* Ongoing: <br>
  - Improvising the documentation part and few changes in the header files to capture all APIS.
  - Optimising the main README.md in par with the other RocmSoftwarePlaftorm projects
  - Furtthermore, introducing changes for the more MD files and integrate with sphinx documentation for better redability.
  - Automating the pdf generation based on the latex generated by the shpinx-latex.
* In future: <br>
  - Adapt the hiptensorContractionFind API to different set of available algorithms on the different accelerators.
  - Adapt the hiptensorContractionGetWorkspace API as per the future backends.
  - Also, to adapt the library to handle for the FP64 tensors <br>
    (Pending due to compiler issue:  https://ontrack-internal.amd.com/browse/SWDEV-335738).
  - Need to make few modularisation in the ck part of the core logic handling all the datatypes.
* Current Status: <br>
  - Adpated all the hipTENSOR APIs to the cuTENSOR style and were able to verify the results.
  - Completed all the necessary changes required for the tensor contraction on the FP32 tensors.
  - Integrated the package documentation with the sphinx+doxygen+breathe for better redability.
